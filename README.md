# Coding Quiz

## Description

This project is a timed coding quiz that utilizes JavaScript and Local Storage to dynamically update HTML and CSS. User answers questions about coding concepts; both correct and incorrect answers take the user to the next question, but incorrect answers deduct 10 seconds from the time clock. After all questions have been answered or timer runs out, the game ends. The user inputs their initials and the final score is equal to the remaining seconds left on the timer. User initials and score are stored in Local Storage, to be displayed on the high scores page.
